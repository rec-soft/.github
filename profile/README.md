# Recreational Software Group

The Recreational Software Group (RecSoft) is an organization focused on building software projects for the joy (or recreation) of creation itself. These projects may not be beautiful, feature-rich, or even useful. But they represent the materialized version of something that previously only existed in its creator(s)' head(s).
